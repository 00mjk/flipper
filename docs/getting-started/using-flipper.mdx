The desktop part of Flipper doesn't need any particular setup. Simply download the latest build for [Mac](https://www.facebook.com/fbflipper/public/mac), [Linux](https://www.facebook.com/fbflipper/public/linux) or [Windows](https://www.facebook.com/fbflipper/public/windows) and launch it. In order to work properly, Flipper requires a working installation of the Android and (if where applicable) iOS development tools on your system, as well as the [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org) binary on your `$PATH`.

OpenSSL for Windows can be downloaded [here](https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html).

Once you start Flipper and launch an emulator/simulator or connect a device, you will already be able to see the device logs in Flipper. To see app specific data, you need to integrate our native SDKs with your app.
