Flipper helps you debug Android and iOS apps running in an emulator/simulator or connected physical development devices. Flipper consists of two parts:

- The desktop app
- The native mobile SDKs for Android and iOS

To use Flipper, you need to add the mobile SDK to your app. If you are using React Native 0.62 or higher, this is largely done automatically for you.
